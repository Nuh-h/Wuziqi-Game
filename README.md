# Wuziqi-Game
This is the famous Chinese game 五子棋 - WuZiQi - also known as Five-in-a-Row/Gomoku.

I had an idea on how to keep track of game states, so I am going to try and implement it!

I thought I might first test myself on Tic-Tac-Toe, as they are very similar and in fact differ only by goalposts and field-size.

TODO: add (info) button on the rules of the game. A reset/restart option, countdown section, maybe live-version of pick from the cup of beans, explanations of the colors, pick 12x12 or 15x15, lastly option to type in names.
