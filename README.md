# Wuziqi-Game
This is the famous Chinese game 五子棋 - WuZiQi - also known as Five-in-a-Row/Gomoku.

I had an idea on how to keep track of game states, so I am going to try and implement it!

I thought I might first test myself on Tic-Tac-Toe, as they are very similar and in fact differ only by goalposts and field-size.
